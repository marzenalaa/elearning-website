# E-learning Webpage.

This webpage is a personal project I built from scratch using HTML and CSS. It was inspired from TheemZaa and serves as a practical exercise to solidify my knowledge and understanding of these web development technologies.

Technologies Used:
 - HTML
 - CSS

Project Goals:
 - To gain hands-on experience with HTML and CSS.
 - To experiment with different design elements and layouts.

Additional Notes:
 - This project is still under development. Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements.
 - The code may not be fully optimized or follow best practices, as it primarily serves as a learning exercise.
